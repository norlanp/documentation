# What to do when a website blocks registration with SimpleLogin

Most websites and online services allow you to register with your SimpleLogin alias. However, there have been reports of some websites not accepting a SimpleLogin domain.

### **What to do when a Website is blocking SimpleLogin?**

> Report the website to: [antiabuse@proton.me](mailto:antiabuse@proton.me?subject=This%20website%20blocks%20registration%20with%20SimpleLogin:%20https://thisdomain.com&body=Hi%20there,%20I%20want%20to%20report%20a%20website%20that%20is%20blocking%20me%20to%20register%20using%20my%20SimpleLogin%20email%20alias.)

We keep track of all the websites reported, do further testing and manually reach out the website to ask for the block to be removed.

### **How to know if a website is blocking SimpleLogin?**

You will notice this when website is blocking you to register with your unique SimpleLogin alias. Some websites are transparent and display an error message like *“This email address is not accepted”*.

Other websites are sending more generic error messages or not even display any error. In that case, try registering with another email address (proton.me or gmail.com).

### **Why SimpleLogin is not a throwaway email service?**

- You need an account to use SimpleLogin
- All aliases generated are unique
- Multiple anti-abuse automation
- Anti-SPAM limitations
- All SimpleLogin aliases is permanent, untill user will decide to delete them
- Registration of multiple accounts on the same service by single user is not allowed [by ToS](https://simplelogin.io/terms/)

SimpleLogin is an email aliasing tool that allow users to add a layer of privacy and security while browsing online.

### **How to get SimpleLogin unblocked?**

Another way to resolve the problem is to get your [subdomain](https://simplelogin.io/docs/subdomain/new/) or [add your custom domain to SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/docs/custom-domain/add-domain/) (this is a Premium feature).  

### **Email template to send to websites that block SimpleLogin**

> **To:** Customer support email address

> **Subject:** Unable to register with my unique SimpleLogin email alias

> *Hello,*

> *I am reaching out to seek your assistance with an issue I encountered while attempting to register my account with your service. Despite being unable to use my SimpleLogin email alias myemailalias@simplelogin.com during the sign-up process, I believe the block on SimpleLogin alias on your domain might have been an oversight.*

>*SimpleLogin has gained significant popularity among users worldwide, serving as a tool for protecting their online identities against SPAM and phishing by providing unique email aliases. This service is part of Proton AG, one of the most popular encrypted email providers.*
